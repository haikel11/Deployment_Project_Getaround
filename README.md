[GetAround](https://www.getaround.com/?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) is the Airbnb for cars. You can rent cars from any person for a few hours to a few days! Founded in 2009, this company has known rapid growth. In 2019, they count over 5 million users and about 20K available cars worldwide. 

As Jedha's partner, they offered this great challenges: 

## Context 

When renting a car, our users have to complete a checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental in order to:

* Assess the state of the car and notify other parties of pre-existing damages or damages that occurred during the rental.
* Compare fuel levels.
* Measure how many kilometers were driven.

The checkin and checkout of our rentals can be done with three distinct flows:
* **üì± Mobile** rental agreement on native apps: driver and owner meet and both sign the rental agreement on the owner‚Äôs smartphone
* **Connect:** the driver doesn‚Äôt meet the owner and opens the car with his smartphone
* **üìù Paper** contract (negligible)

## Project

For this case study, we suggest that you put yourselves in our shoes, and run an analysis we made back in 2017 üîÆ ü™Ñ

When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.

Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day : Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasn‚Äôt returned on time.

### Documentation page

You need to provide the users with a **documentation** about your API.

It has to be located at the `/docs` of your website. If we take the URL example above, it should be located directly at `https://your-url.com/docs`).

This small documentation should at least include:
- An h1 title: the title is up to you.
- A description of every endpoints the user can call with the endpoint name, the HTTP method, the required input and the expected output (you can give example).

You are free to add other any other relevant informations and style your HTML as you wish.

### Online production

You have to **host your API online**. We recommend you to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as it is free of charge. But you are free to choose any other hosting provider.

## Deliverable

To complete this project, you should deliver:

- A **dashboard** in production (accessible via a web page for example)
- The **whole code** stored in a **Github repository**. You will include the repository's URL.
- An **documented online API** on Heroku server (or any other provider you choose) containing at least **one `/predict` endpoint** that respect the technical description above. 

## Data 

There are two files you need to download: 

* [Delay Analysis](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/get_around_delay_analysis.xlsx) Data Analysis 
* [Pricing Optimization](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deployment/get_around_pricing_project.csv) Machine Learning
